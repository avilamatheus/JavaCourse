         * There are two general-purpose List implementations â€”
         * ArrayList and LinkedList. Most of the time, you'll probably use ArrayList,
         * which offers constant-time positional access and is just plain fast.
         * It does not have to allocate a node object for each element in the List,
         * and it can take advantage of System.arraycopy when it has to move multiple elements at the same time.
         * Think of ArrayList as Vector without the synchronization overhead.
         *
         * If you frequently add elements to the beginning of the List or iterate
         * over the List to delete elements from its interior, you should consider using LinkedList.
         * These operations require constant-time in a LinkedList and linear-time in an ArrayList.
         * But you pay a big price in performance. Positional access requires linear-time in a
         * LinkedList and constant-time in an ArrayList. Furthermore, the constant factor for LinkedList
         * is much worse. If you think you want to use a LinkedList, measure the performance of your application
         * with both LinkedList and ArrayList before making your choice; ArrayList is usually faster.
